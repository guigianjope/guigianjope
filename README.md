### Hello there 

My name is Guilherme Gianjope from Brazil (🇧🇷). I have a beautiful wife and a cute little dog. 

I've been working with technology since 2011. I'm very creative and passionate about Technology.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), and I like to talk about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
